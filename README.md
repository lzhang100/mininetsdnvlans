# sdncmpe294

This is a SDN demo involving VLANs. In this demo, we own a company called Foogle and in Foogle there is a sales department and hr department. How can we logical segment the network so that the traffic in the sales department stays in the sales department and the traffic in the hr department stays in the hr department? H1 and H3 are part of the Sales Department and able to communicate with each other. Similarly, H2and H4 are part of the HR Department and able to communicate with each other. However, H1 and H2 are not part of the same department and not able to communicate with each other. The demo is ran in Mininet Virtualization envrioment. 

Run the application using: 
sudo python myfirstexpr.py
